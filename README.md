# Zircon

Zircon is a work-in-progress entity-component system (ECS) implementation
in Rust. Zircon aims to be fast, concurrent and highly extensible, allowing
developers to use their own ways of storing data and code, but at the same time
providing efficient and easy to use default implementations.
